![DBLLL](https://github.com/RoseInjector/DB-LEGENDS-API/assets/138173273/d0191e53-9e9b-4881-a654-a30de70600be)

Welcome to the DB Legends Python module! This module allows you to access and retrieve information about Dragon Ball Legends characters from the provided `chars.json` file.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RoseInjector/DB-LEGENDS-API.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd DB-LEGENDS-API
   ```

3. Run the DB Legends Python script:

   ```bash
   python db_legends.py
   ```

## Usage

To use the DB Legends Python module, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have the `chars.json` file in the same directory as the script.

2. Run the script and provide the character ID when prompted.

   ```bash
   python db_legends.py
   ```

3. The script will display detailed information about the character with the provided ID, including their name, ID, color, rarity, tags, base stats, and max stats.

## Example

Suppose you want to retrieve information about the character with the ID `DBL51-03U`. Here's how to do it:

```bash
python db_legends.py
Enter the character ID to find (e.g., DBL51-03U): DBL51-03U
```

The script will then display the character's information:

```
Character Information:
Name: [Character Name]
ID: DBL51-03U
Color: [Character Color]
Rarity: [Character Rarity]
Tags: [Tag 1], [Tag 2], ...
Base Stats:
[Stat 1]: [Value]
[Stat 2]: [Value]
...
Max Stats:
[Stat 1]: [Value]
[Stat 2]: [Value]
...
```
